Preprint submitted to biorxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.135004v1

Several larger files which were used part of these analyses are included alongside supplemental data on Mendeley due to GitHub file size limits: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c6pdfrwxgj/3.

## Instructions

All code used to analyze data and generate figures from this manuscript have been released within this github page, with some larger files (>100mb) stored on Mendeley data (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c6pdfrwxgj/3). In order to replicate analysis presented in this manuscript, follow the steps listed below.  R v3.5.2 and Python vXYZ were used for these analyses:

1. Clone this repository onto your local computer
2. Download the large data files (along with supplemental tables) from the above Mendeley data link.
3. Unpack the large data file from above.  The subdirectories contained in this file correspond to the same order as those within the github repository.  Merge the large data files together with your local repository files.
4. For Figures 2-3, Fig. S1-S6, and Table S1-S8: Open the R file "Main_figures_resubmission.R" in the repository root directory, changing the "WORKING_ROOT" variable (line 2) to the path of the repository.  This file contains a step-by-step workflow for recreating these above listed figures.
5. For Figures...
